# Restaurant_Revenue_Prediction
Annual sales prediction for potential restaurants based on Demographic data, Real estate data, and Commercial data. 
High dimensional data, with 43 features and 137 data points. Predicting revenue for 100,000 potential restaurants. I've tried Lasso regression model, simple linear regression model as well as Random Forest Model. So far the Random Forest model seems to be performing the best.
